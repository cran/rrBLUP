Changes in 4.2:
* shrink=FALSE is now the default in A.mat
* Only return imputed markers in A.mat when impute=TRUE

Changes in 4.1:
* Replaced function GWA with GWAS for association mapping.  Improvements include (1) P3D is now optional, (2) multiple phenotypes handled, (3) Manhattan and qq plots are generated, (4) uses data frame for input.
* Changed default to reduce=FALSE in kin.blup

Changes in 4.0:

* kinship.BLUP is no longer being improved.  It has been replaced by kin.blup, which has a more intuitve interface.
* Shrinkage estimation functionality has been added to A.mat, which is beneficial at low marker density.

Changes in 3.8:

* Fixed error regarding imputation of monomorphic markers in A.mat.

Changes in 3.7:

* Improved handling of positive semi-definite kinship matrix in mixed.solve.

Changes in 3.6:

* Improved error handling in mixed.solve.

Changes in 3.5:

* Labels now transfer from input to output with mixed.solve.

Changes in 3.4:

* Additional features for A.mat.

Changes in 3.3:

* Improved handling of missing genotype data in A.mat.
* Removed impute function.  Imputation is now done through A.mat.

Changes in 3.2:

* Parallel computation enabled for GWA, A.mat, and kinship.BLUP.
* Missing genotypic data permitted for GWA.

Changes in 3.1:

* Fixed error in regression coefficient for adjusted A.mat.

Changes in 3.0:

* Major changes to A.mat.  Read the help manual.

Changes in 2.8:

* Added NEWS file
* Updated A.mat to calculate both the raw and adjusted UAR models.

Changes in 2.7:

* Updated mixed.solve to handle missing observations.
* Updated A.mat to handle missing alleles.

Changes in 2.5:

* rrBLUP manuscript is published.  Included CITATION file.
