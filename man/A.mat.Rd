\arguments{
\item{X}{matrix (\eqn{n \times m}) of unphased genotypes for \eqn{n} lines and \eqn{m} biallelic markers, coded as \{-1,0,1\}. Fractional (imputed) and missing values (NA) are allowed.}

\item{min.MAF}{Minimum minor allele frequency. The A matrix is not sensitive to rare alleles, so by default only monomorphic markers are removed.}

\item{max.missing}{Maximum proportion of missing data; default removes completely missing markers.}

\item{impute.method}{There are two options. The default is "mean", which imputes with the mean for each marker.  The "EM" option imputes with an EM algorithm (see details).}

\item{tol}{Specifies the convergence criterion for the EM algorithm (see details).}

\item{n.core}{Specifies the number of cores to use for parallel execution of the EM algorithm}

\item{shrink}{set shrink=FALSE to disable shrinkage estimation.  See Details for how to enable shrinkage estimation.}

\item{return.imputed}{When TRUE, the imputed marker matrix is returned.}
}
\value{
If return.imputed = FALSE, the \eqn{n \times n} additive relationship matrix is returned. If return.imputed = TRUE, the function returns a list containing

 \item{$A}{the A matrix}
 \item{$imputed}{the imputed marker matrix}

\details{
At high marker density, the relationship matrix is estimated as \eqn{A=W W'/c}, where \eqn{W_{ik} = X_{ik} + 1 - 2 p_k} and \eqn{p_k} is the frequency of the 1 allele at marker k.  By using a normalization constant of \eqn{c = 2 \sum_k {p_k (1-p_k)}}, the mean of the diagonal elements is \eqn{1 + f} (Endelman and Jannink 2012).
The EM imputation algorithm is based on the multivariate normal distribution and was designed for use with GBS (genotyping-by-sequencing) markers, which tend to be high density but with lots of missing data.  Details are given in Poland et al. (2012). The EM algorithm stops at iteration \eqn{t} when the RMS error = \eqn{n^{-1} \|A_{t} - A_{t-1}\|_2} < tol.  
Shrinkage estimation can improve the accuracy of genome-wide marker-assisted selection, particularly at low marker density (Endelman and Jannink 2012). The shrinkage intensity ranges from 0 (no shrinkage) to 1 (\eqn{A=(1+f)I}). Two algorithms for estimating the shrinkage intensity are available.  The first is the method described in Endelman and Jannink (2012) and is specified by \code{shrink=list(method="EJ")}.  The second involves designating a random sample of the markers as simulated QTL and then regressing the A matrix based on the QTL against the A matrix based on the remaining markers (Yang et al. 2010; Mueller et al. 2015). The regression method is specified by \code{shrink=list(method="REG",n.qtl=100,n.iter=5)}, where the parameters \code{n.qtl} and \code{n.iter} can be varied to adjust the number of simulated QTL and number of iterations, respectively.  
The shrinkage and EM-imputation options are designed for opposite scenarios (low vs. high density) and cannot be used simultaneously. 
When the EM algorithm is used, the imputed alleles can lie outside the interval [-1,1].  Polymorphic markers that do not meet the min.MAF and max.missing criteria are not imputed.
